        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the perfect recipe for fall/winter season. It is a family favorite filled with warm spices, juicy apples, and delicious salted caramel.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Homemade Pie Crust or All Butter Pie Crust (both recipes make 2 crusts, 1 for bottom and 1 for top)</li>
            <li>1 cup (240ml) salted caramel sauce, divided (I recommend my Homemade Salted Caramel)</li>
            <li>10 cups (1250g) 1/4-inch-thick apple slices (about 8 large peeled and cored apples)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon (15ml) fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (31g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice OR ground cloves (either are fine)</li>
            <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk</li>
            <li>optional: coarse sugar for sprinkling on crust</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The crust:</strong> Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5.
            <li>If you are not using store-bought salted caramel sauce, make the homemade version. You’ll want to make it now so it can cool as the pie dough chills in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the filling:</strong> In a large bowl, stir the apple slices, sugar, lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, allspice/cloves, and nutmeg together until thoroughly combined. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).</li>
            <li><strong>Roll out the chilled pie dough:</strong> On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish that’s 1.5 to 2 inches deep. Tuck the dough in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth.</li>
            <li><strong>the filling into the crust.</strong> It will seem like a lot of apples; that’s ok. Pile them high, and tightly together. Drizzle evenly with 1/2 cup (120ml) of the caramel sauce. It’s ok if the caramel sauce is still a little warm. (If homemade salted caramel has solidified, warm it on the stove or in the microwave until it’s pourable.)</li>
            <li><strong>Finish assembling:</strong> Remove the other disc of chilled pie dough from the refrigerator. Roll the dough into a circle that is 12 to 14 inches diameter. Using a pastry wheel, sharp knife, or pizza cutter, cut strips of dough; in the pictured pie, I cut 18 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch wide strips. Carefully thread the strips over and under one another, pulling back strips as necessary to weave. (Here’s a lattice pie crust tutorial if you need visuals.) Use a small paring knife or kitchen shears to trim off excess dough. Fold the overhang back towards the center of the pie, and pinch the edges to adhere the top and bottom crusts together. Crimp or flute the pie crust edges to seal.</li>
            <li>Lightly brush the top of the pie crust with the egg wash. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar, if using.</li>
            <li>Place the pie onto a large baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Then, keeping the pie in the oven, reduce the oven temperature down to 375°F (190°C). Place a pie crust shield (see Note for homemade shield) on the edges to prevent them from over-browning. Continue baking the pie until the caramel apple filling is bubbling around the edges, 35–40 more minutes. This sounds like a long time, but under-baking the pie means an unfinished filling with firm apples with paste-like flour. If you want to be precise, the internal temperature of the filling taken with an instant read thermometer should be around 200°F (93°C) when done. Tip: If needed towards the end of bake time, remove the pie crust shield and tent an entire piece of foil on top of the pie if the top looks like it’s getting too brown.</li>
            <li>Remove pie from the oven, place on a cooling rack, and cool for at least 3 hours before slicing and serving. Filling will be too juicy if the pie is warm when you slice it. Drizzle the entire pie or each slice with remaining salted caramel.</li>
            <li>​​Cover and store leftover pie at room temperature for up to 1 day or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
