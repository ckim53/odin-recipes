        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These Buttery Coconut Oatmeal Cookies have a thin, crisp edge and a soft chewy center. Adding coconut to cookies is magic when it comes to creating that soft, chewy texture!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup old fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sweetened coconut</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons light corn syrup</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>To the bowl of an electric mixer, add oats, flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, coconut, salt and baking soda. Mix on medium low speed for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, add butter and corn syrup to a small saucepan and heat until melted over medium high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil for one minute and then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Slowly drizzle the butter mixture into the flour mixture, mixing on medium low speed. The mixture will be crumbly. Add the egg, and mix again until a dough comes together.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into tablespoon sized balls, and place on the parchment lined baking sheet (12 per sheet). Bake at 350 degrees for 10-11 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown, with a slightly pale center. They will brown quickly, so keep a close watch toward the end of the baking time.</li>
        </ol>
